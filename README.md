THINK ABOUT THESE

1. Single-cell RNA: combines RNA-seq and flow cytometry. Compare to standard, bulk RNA-seq: more data, more zeros, ...
2. Spatial RNA-seq

Possibly some single-cell RNA data available on:

2. Sandy Hayes is a pro on flow cyt in oncology

3. FlowJo has 30-day free trial if needed.

CD3+  = T-cells
CD4+ = monocyte
Can do intercellular staining for cytokine secretion
Spectral flow cytometry
Stain Index = each fluorochrome has different stain intensity. For more abundant proteins use dimmer flours; for less abundant ones - brighter flour.
Use colors that are maximally spread out (in terms of wave length)
FSC-A ~ SSC-A = separate debries
FSC-A ~ FSC-H = separate singlets
Comp-APC-Cy7-A ~ SSC-A = separate live cells
Always ask for compansation file along with FCS files!
Check total number of events (= cells)! If pipet gets clogged, only debrees will pass through and /or total number of events will go down.
Make sure thetre are enough events in the gates (>100? >1,000?)
Rarify samples?y0
