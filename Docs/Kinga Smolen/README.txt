1. Polychromatic flow cytometric high-throughput assay to analyze the innate immune response to Toll-like receptor stimulation (nihms60076.pdf). Modification of the study protocol. All biology. Markers and gating strategy. Reference it in Methods and/or use it in Results/Discussion to explain the results of our analysis.

2. Antibody Responses to Vaccination among South African HIVExposed and Unexposed Uninfected Infants during the First 2 Years of Life (reikie-et-al-2013-antibody-responses-to-vaccination-among-south-african-hiv-exposed-and-unexposed-uninfected-infants.pdf). Study design: number of infants in each group, timepoints, summary statistics. NOTE: infants were not vacinated fo missles until 9mo of age so our data (6mo) is vaccine-naive. Other vaccines were done by 6mo.

3. Single cell analysis of innate cytokine responses to pattern recognition receptor stimulation in children across four
continents (emss-59604.pdf). Healthy 2 yo children from South African, BE, CA and Equador. Identified significant variation in a cellular composition of whole blood. Significant reduction of cytokine production in SA children's monocytes (MHCII+), cDC and pDC (CD123+). 

4. OMIP-038: Innate Immune Assessment with a 14 Color Flow Cytometry Panel (Cytometry Pt A - 2017 - Smolen - OMIP‚Äê038  Innate immune assessment with a 14 color flow cytometry panel.pdf). Kinga's paper that explains gating using same biomarkers. CD14 vs MHCII separates APCs (monocytes and DCs are MHCII+). CD11c and CD123 identifies plasmocytoid DC(pDC) (CD11c-/CD123+) and conventional DC (cDC)(CD11c+/CD123-). plasmocytoid DC(pDC). CD11c-/CD123-  = B-cells. Use these in the duscussion of the results and subgroups.

5. From Mahan: Association of maternal and infant inflammation with neurodevelopment in HIV-exposed uninfected children in a South African birth cohort (Maternal and infant neurodevelopment HIV). African infants exposed to HIV had significantly lower levels of cytokines. Same as Mahan's findings and in #3. HIV in SA is a different strain? Also, different cell composition.
